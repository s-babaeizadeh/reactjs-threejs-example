<h1>Threejs Example</h1>
<p>Three.js is a popular JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics in a web browser. An example of using Three.js is to create a simple 3D rotating cube. This can be achieved by setting up a scene, camera, and renderer, and then adding a cube geometry to the scene, applying a material, and implementing an animation loop to rotate the cube continuously.</p>
